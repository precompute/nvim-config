* nvim

[21-11-29 21:50:00] nvim is useful in a pinch.

Unfortunately, my primary editor is Emacs.

This is my config for a rainy day.  I tried to make it as similar to my configured emacs as possible.

I use Neovim 0.6.0.  This config should be immediately usable after running ~:PackerSync~.

I ported my old vimscript config to lua.  The old config is saved as ~.back~.

I used [[https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim][kickstart]] to familiarize myself with the new lua config.

Some parts of this config contain lines from [[https://github.com/folke/dot/tree/master/config/nvim][user "folke"'s nvim config.]]
